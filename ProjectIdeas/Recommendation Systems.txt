Recommendation Systems

If you’ve ever been recommended to purchase from Amazon when exiting their platform or browsing something, you’ve already seen the recommendation system
 in its full colour. It is the digital marketing retargeting or display advertising that is used by various websites and applications to convert their
 users to purchase maker customers. But have you ever noticed that the advertisements being displayed on your and your friend’s device are quite different? 
Here is where AI/ML come into the picture. Now, what you need to understand is that Python as a language embeds many other tools such as AI and ML so that we
 can take advantage of that as well. The recommendation systems are the simplest kind of python projects for resumes that you can go for as they do not require
 much effort and brain. Moreover, python provides many inbuilt training models like linear regression that can help you to build your recommendation system in 
just 20 to 30 lines of code.

But we have to have browsing history, purchase history, client behaviour, session details, favourites, and more to make our system churn out good recommendations. 
You just need to input all this information inside your training model and then test your model with custom input values. You can also calculate the accuracy of
 your model by using the values for which you already have the solutions or recommendations. You can create a product recommendation, movie recommendation, 
diagnosis recommendation, purchase recommendation and, other systems easily with different ML algorithms.
