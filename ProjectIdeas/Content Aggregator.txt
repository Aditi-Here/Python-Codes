Content Aggregator
This is a tool that gathers information such as articles, social media posts, videos, images and so on. 
Then it displays all that information under one page. This means that users donâ€™t have to manually search each website for what they are looking for.

Creating one is another good way to showcase how you can use your Python expertise to create a useful tool. Content aggregators can be used for many purposes,
 but they essentially search large swaths of the internet to find specific pieces of information.

You could develop a general content aggregator or a more specialized one. For example, you might create a weather aggregator that pulls weather data from several
 of the top sources in your region to present a comprehensive weather report.

Working on a project like this you should be comforatble with concepts like:

Python Basics
How to make use of virtual environments
Django fundamentals
Basics of HTML, CSS and JS
