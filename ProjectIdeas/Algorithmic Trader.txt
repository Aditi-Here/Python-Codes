Algorithmic Trader

Algorithmic or Algo traders can not only showcase your Python skills, but they can also make you money - if you write a good script, that is.

This is a more advanced project that will likely not be suitable for beginner coders. Youâ€™ll need to write a script that analyzes past and present stock values, 
and uses machine learning to predict future values.

Then, your trader will automatically buy or sell shares based on those predictions.

In order to work on such a project, getting comfortable with Python and some of it's major topics like Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming
 will be necessity. Also knowing how to use external libraries 
like Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy will be helpful.

To help you get started with this knowledge, check out this course, Algorithmic Trading Using Python (and it includes some sample repos as well.
