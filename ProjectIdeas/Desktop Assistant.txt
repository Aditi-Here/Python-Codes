When speaking about an assistant, think about Alexa, Siri and Google's virtual assistant. Lately there have been a rise in development of smart assistants, 
take a look at your favorite website chances are very high it has a bot that answers common question asked regularly.

Some common tasks that can be handled in your local machine with the help of an assistant include:

Open and close any application on your system.
Search anything on Google, Youtube, Wikipedia and so on
Get weather updates for any location asked.
Tell current time & date
Give calendar reminders on upcoming events.
Send email through voice commands.
Play or Stop music in our system.
Solve any algebraic and mathematical problems.
Restart, Sleep or Shut Down the system.
In order to build a desktop assistant, you might need some modules to help out. Some of the key ones include: Pyttsx3, Speech Recognition, Twilio, 
Subprocesses, Wikipedia, and a web browser.

A desktop assistant can perform a single task or a variety of tasks, depending on the complexity of your coding. The more advanced your assistant is, 
the more impressive it will be to potential employers.

Speaking from experience, this can be a really amazing project to work on. Although I wasn't able to explore more functionalities, check out my 
idea for a Desktop Assistant and implement more by adding your own ideas for features.
