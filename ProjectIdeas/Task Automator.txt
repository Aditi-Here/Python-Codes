A task automator can be similar to a desktop assistant. But it can also be more specialized for specific tasks. To give an idea of how developers utilize Python
 here are some of the most common automations:

Performing automated market tasks
Sending out, replying to, and sorting emails
Filling out PDFs and Excel files
Converting images, renaming files
Performing math equations
Calculating exchange rates
You can use Python to do alot of more tasks, too – just think of the tasks you do on daily basis, not only on your computer but at home too. 
You just have to figure out the correct tools you’ll need, and how to write and run the script.

When we talk of tools, since Python is an open-source language, it means we have a ton of tools at our disposal, as well as many libraries and frameworks 
to help us get started. Some great tools that can help you out include:

Selenium
Beautiful Soup
SMTPlib
A good resource to help out in the automation journey is the amazing book on how to Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. It is a practical guide on how to 
use various programming tools.

Again, the more unique and advanced your task automator is, the more impressive it will be.
